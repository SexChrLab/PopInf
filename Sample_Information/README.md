# Sample Information
This folder contains two files:
1. `ThousandGenomesSamples_AdmxRm.txt` This file contains the sample information for the 1000 genomes reference panel we use in this tutorial.
2. `ThousandGenomesSamples_Admx_samples.txt` This file contains the sample information from a small number of admixed samples from 1000 genomes data set. We have this file here to represent the "unknown" sample set. You may wish to test PopInf prior to running your own samples and we suggest using this small sample set.
