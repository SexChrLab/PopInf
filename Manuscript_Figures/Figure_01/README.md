# Figure 1
This readme contains the script and input files to generate figure 1 from our manuscript, "PopInf: An approach for reproducibly visualizing and assigning population affiliation in genomic samples of uncertain origin"


To re-create figure 1, do the following
```
# Activate the PopInf cond environment if not already activated
source activate PopInf

# Run Rscript
Rscript Fig_01.R

```

By running the above a file named, `FIGURE_01.pdf` will be created in the folder called, `OUTPUT/`.
