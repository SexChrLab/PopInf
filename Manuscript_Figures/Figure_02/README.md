This readme contains the script and input files to generate figure 2 from our manuscript, "PopInf: An approach for reproducibly visualizing and assigning population affiliation in genomic samples of uncertain origin"

To run the script, run the following command:

```
Rscript Fig_02.R
```

Note: there are variables at the top of this script like directory and chromosomes to analyze that need to be updated if you wish to run this script.
