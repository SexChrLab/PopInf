This readme contains the script and input files to generate figure 2 from our manuscript, "PopInf: An approach for reproducibly visualizing and assigning population affiliation in genomic samples of uncertain origin"

## GTEx Heat Map for All Individuals

The following script will produce the figure seen as figure 2A that showcases the inferred population of all of the GTEx samples by assigning a unique color to each population group. This script utilizes the inferred ancestry reports generated by PopInf.

Ensure that the script and the input files are in the same directory. We have provided the input files used to make the figure in the manuscript in the "`INPUTS`" folder.

To run the script, run the following command:

```
Rscript GTEx_Heatmaps.R
```

## GTEx Heat Map for Individuals with Chromosomal Variation

The following script will produce the figure seen as figure 2B that showcases the inferred populations for the chromosomes that have different inferred populations across the chromosomes.  This script utilizes the inferred ancestry reports generated by PopInf.

Ensure that the script and the input files are in the same directory. We have provided the input files used to make the figure in the manuscript in the "`INPUTS`" folder.

To run the script, run the following command:

``` 
Rscript GTEx_Additional_Heatmaps.R
```

## TCGA Heat Map for All Individuals

The following script will produce the figure seen as figure 2C that showcases the inferred population of all of the TCGA samples by assigning a unique color to each population group. This script utilizes the inferred ancestry reports generated by PopInf.

Ensure that the script and the input files are in the same directory. We have provided the input files used to make the figure in the manuscript in the "`INPUTS`" folder.

To run the script, run the following command:

```
Rscript TCGA_Heatmaps.R
```

## TCGA Heat Map for Individuals with Chromosomal Variation

The following script will produce the figure seen as figure 2D that showcases the inferred populations for the chromosomes that have different inferred populations across the chromosomes.  This script utilizes the inferred ancestry reports generated by PopInf.

Ensure that the script and the input files are in the same directory. We have provided the input files used to make the figure in the manuscript in the "`INPUTS`" folder.

To run the script, run the following command:

``` 
Rscript TCGA_Additional_Heatmaps.R
```
