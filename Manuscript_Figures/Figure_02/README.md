This readme contains the script and input files to generate figure 2 from our manuscript, "PopInf: An approach for reproducibly visualizing and assigning population affiliation in genomic samples of uncertain origin"

## GTEx HeatMaps

The following script will produce the figure that showcases the inferred population of all of the GTEx samples by assigning a unique color to each population group. This script utilizes the inferred ancestry reports generated by PopInf.

To run the script:

### STEP 1

Ensure that the script and the input files are in the same directory. We have provided the input files used to make the figure in the manuscript in the 'INPUTS' folder.
