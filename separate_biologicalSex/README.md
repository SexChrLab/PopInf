# Separating Files by Biological Sex
This document will guide you through separating your reference panel and unknown panel files by biological sex if you wish to analyze each biological sex separately.

## What you need to separate the files by biological sex
1. High performance computer (the reference files will likely be very large if you are analyzing sites across the entire genome).
2. VCF files for the reference panel separated by chromosome.
3. VCF files for the unknown panel separated by chromosome.
3. Reference panel sample list with biological sexes specified (If using 1000 Genomes, we provide the list in this folder).
4. Unknown panel sample list with biological sexes specified.
